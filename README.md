# 🚀 Xpress: Dynamic, Context-Aware Robot Facial Expressions

Xpress is a system that dynamically generates expressive, **context-aware facial expressions** for robots using **language models (LLMs)**. By leveraging textual and socio-emotional context, Xpress enables robots to **adaptively express emotions** across various interaction scenarios. We demonstrate and provide implementation for the following domains: **storytelling and real-time conversations**.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **LLM-Powered**: Uses state-of-the-art **language models** for three-staged facial expression generation.
- 🎭 **Dynamic Facial Expressions**: Generates **non-repetitive, nuanced** facial expressions tailored to each interaction context.
- 📖 **Storytelling & Conversations**: Supports **storytelling** and **real-time chat experiences**.
- 🏗️ **Scalable & Open-Source**: Easily adaptable to different robot platforms.
